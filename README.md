## 1. Problem Statement
*   The Financial Management System is a software that is used to check the 
authenticity of a particular transaction in a financial company.
*   In Financial Management System, participants must create a model for 
predicting fraudulent transactions for a financial company and then use the model's 
insights to create an actionable plan. The case's data is stored in a CSV file with 
6362620 rows and 10 columns.

## 3. Our analysis on data
*   We found that 3 categories did not hv fraud so we removed them
*   Dataset was completely unbalanced

## 4. ML model used : 
Decision Tree Classifier

## 5. Reason for selecting Decision Tree:
## 6. Reason for selecting Decision Tree:
*   Decision Tree Classifier showed the highest recall, accuracyy and F1 score when compared to others:
*   Recall - 99.1799 % | Acc - 99.124 % | f1 - 99.108 %
*   **Rejecting other networks because:**
*   Neural Networks are rejected because it obviously takes a LOT of training time & computation power
*   Performance of other models that were tested are:
 _______________________________________________
| Model               |  Recall(%)  |  F1(%)    |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression |   85.721    |   88.7021 |
| SVM                 |   84.02     |   88      |
| Naive bayes         |   46        |   88      |
| Kernel SVM          |   81.478    |   87.06   |
